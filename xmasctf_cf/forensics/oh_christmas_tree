## Oh Christmas Tree

Type: Forensics
Flag Format: X-MAS{this_is_a_flag}
Difficulty: ez
File location: oct.jpg


This is an ezpz steganography question:
the flag is hidden in plaintext inside the image data, but is broken up into parts.



Opening the file in a text editor and browsing through will reveal the flag in parts, reconstruct it.

You **could** try and grep X-MAS from the file, but as it's split into parts it would take some fiddling.
