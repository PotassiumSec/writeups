## Santa the Weaver

Type: Forensics (but called 'misc')
Flag Format: X-MAS{this_is_a_flag}
Difficulty: ez
File location: flag.jpg



This is very easy, the flag is hidden in plain text in the image.

you can open the image in a hex or text editor and find 'X-MAS' to get to the flag.

Alternatively you could grep it with -a (we're dealing with a non-text file).
