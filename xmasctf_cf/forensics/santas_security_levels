## Santa's Security Levels

Type: Forensics
Flag Format: special
Difficulty: fun
File location: message.mp3 / special message.txt



#### Listening to the MP3
There's a little background noise, but it's clear that this is morse code.

Playing around with a morse decoder program online will give you a github link, it's clear that this leads us to 'special message.txt'



#### Reading the message
special message.txt gives you a paragraph in ROT13. Decode it and you get something way too long to be a flag.

But if you just take the capitals, it provides you the details to submit the flag.

Just slap X-MAS{ } around the decoded text, make sure there are no spaces and it's all in lowercase.
